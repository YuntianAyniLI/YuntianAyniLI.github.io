**Hello, it's** ***Yuntian LI***. <br />
I recieved my BSc in Economics and BSc in Mathematics degree from Renmin University of China, and is now an incoming MSc Economics student at Stockholm School of Economics. My research interest is in the fields of *political economcis*, *monetary policy*, and *computational social science*.

## Research

## Amateur Interest
I have been an amateur in violin, singing and sprinting since young. I also have a passion for Chinese philology and history, classics and following figure skating events.
### Figure Skating
I will post unofficial China national figure skating competition archives of women single skaters videos on my youtube channel [youtube channel]([https://www.youtube.com/@YinYaoyaa]) and [bilibili channel]([https://space.bilibili.com/674939000?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0]) I shot some of the videos at the spot of competition and the others are live recordings. <br />
I'm a huge fan of 金书贤（JIN Shuxian） and Аделия Петросян （Adeliia Petrosian） ~
